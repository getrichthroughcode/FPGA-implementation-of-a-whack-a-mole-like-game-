# FPGA Implementation of Whack-a-Mole Game

![Whack-a-Mole FPGA Game](game_screenshot.png)

## Description

This project involves the implementation of a Whack-a-Mole-like game on an FPGA (Field-Programmable Gate Array) platform. The game is a classic where the player must "whack" or hit emerging moles with a mallet as quickly as possible. The project utilizes hardware description languages (HDLs) such as VHDL for FPGA programming.

## Features

- **Whack-a-Mole Gameplay:** Players interact with the game by using physical buttons or switches on the FPGA board to simulate hitting moles as they appear.

- **Scoring System:** Keep track of the player's score as they successfully hit moles within a specified time limit.

- **LED Display:** Utilize onboard LEDs to create an engaging visual display, indicating the state of the game, score, and time remaining.

## Requirements

- FPGA Development Board (e.g., [XYZ FPGA Board](link-to-fpga-board))
- FPGA Programming Software (e.g., [Vivado](link-to-vivado))

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/FPGA-Whack-a-Mole.git
   cd FPGA-Whack-a-Mole
